# Spam Detection Project

Welcome to the Spam Detection Project! This project aims to build and evaluate machine learning models for detecting spam emails.

## Overview

Spam emails are unsolicited messages that clutter inboxes and can potentially contain harmful content. The goal of this project is to develop an effective spam detection system using various machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Preprocessing of email data to extract relevant features.
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models for spam detection.
- Analysis of model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of labeled emails, consisting of spam and non-spam (ham) messages. The dataset is sourced from [provide source if applicable].

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the dataset, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

## Results

- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.98
- Random Forest Accuracy: 0.97
- SVM Accuracy: 0.99
